## OpenActivityTracker

The idea of this project is to provide a free, open source activity tracker that will evolve into a full fledge fitness tracker for Android and iOS, including a web app that people can use to check all their activities.

### Motivation

The motivation behind this project is the lack of a complete solution for people that want to go to the gym lift some weights and also run or bike and have all their activities tracked in one app, seamlessly. Have a simple way to know how much calories they've burnt in a week. How their weight lifting is evolving and compare that to running or any other exercise.

I've seen many apps but they are either too focused or not good at anything. Some are good enough to use on a daily basis but lack many features or push too much adds and pro plans to the user.
